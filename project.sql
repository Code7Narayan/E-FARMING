For instance, these sensors can detect moisture and nitrogen levels, and the farm can use this information to determine when to water and fertilize rather than rely on a predetermined schedule.

Crop imagery lets a farmer examine crops as if he or she were standing there without actually standing there.

Perhaps the most obvious is the ability to grow within urban environments and thus have fresher foods available faster and at lower costs.

Using minichromosomes, agricultural geneticists can add dozens and perhaps even hundreds of traits to a plant. These traits can be quite complex, such as drought tolerance and nitrogen use. However, what is most intriguing about minichromosomal technology is that a plantâ€™s original chromosomes are not altered in any way.
